        <!-- About Me - Opening -->
        <p>I'm Aspen Wilson, a Realtor and Software Engineer based in the picturesque Pacific Northwest. Originally from this region, I have cherished its breathtaking landscapes and thriving communities. While my roots are here, I've also lived in Colorado for over a decade and briefly ventured to the heart of Missouri.</p>
        <br />
        <!-- About Me - Part 1 -->
        <p>Married and accompanied by two loyal canine companions named Bodhi and Moab, I embrace a life of adventure. Whether I'm hiking along rugged trails, paddleboarding on tranquil waters, or carving through fresh powder on ski slopes, I find solace in nature's beauty. Exploring new places, both locally and internationally, has expanded my worldview, while cherished moments with loved ones keep me grounded.</p>
        <br />
        <!-- About Me - Part 2 -->
        <p>My journey in real estate commenced in January 2023 when I acquired my license. I'm proud to be part of Suntop Realty, a family-driven enterprise led by my sister and her husband. With a commitment to integrity and excellence, I serve areas around the Peninsula, guiding clients through the intricate world of real estate transactions.</p>
        <br />
        <!-- About Me - Part 3 -->
        <p>In the world of coding, my fascination with technology and problem-solving inspired me to dive into software engineering. Having completed the Flatiron School Software Engineering Bootcamp in 2023, I've developed a strong foundation in Python, JavaScript, React, SQLAlchemy, HTML, and CSS. I'm thrilled to apply my coding skills to address real-world challenges and create meaningful solutions. </p>
        <br />
        <!-- About Me - Closing -->
        <p>As a lifelong learner, I'm excited by the intersection of real estate and technology, where innovation and human connection harmonize. Through my dual roles, I'm committed to delivering excellence, whether it's guiding you through the real estate market or crafting innovative software solutions.</p>
